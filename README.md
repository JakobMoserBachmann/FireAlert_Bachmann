# FireAlert_Bachmann

A small Mobile App to Check if someone is still in a building, or not.(During Fire Alert)

To check this, we created a function, that uses the NFC Reader of the mobile phone.

Also we made a a list, where the missing persons can be checkt without scanning, if this person fergot to let his NFC chip scanned.

A list of the Found persons is also part of the app.

Project is made in Android Studio.
